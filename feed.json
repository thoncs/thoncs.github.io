Cooking it under a broiler after marinating in a blend of white miso paste, mirin, sugar, soy sauce, and sake can elevate this dish to a gourmet level. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving a perfect broiled sablefish.</p>\n\n<p><br>### Ingredients<br><br>- **Sablefish fillets** (about 6 ounces each)<br>- **White miso paste** (2 tablespoons)<br>- **Mirin** (2 tablespoons)<br>- **Sugar** (1 tablespoon)<br>- **Soy sauce** (2 tablespoons)<br>- **Sake** (2 tablespoons)<br>- **Sesame oil** (1 teaspoon)<br>- **Garlic** (2 cloves, minced)<br>- **Ginger** (1 teaspoon, grated)<br>- **Green onions** (for garnish)<br>- **Lemon wedges** (for serving)<br><br>### Instructions<br><br>#### Step 1: Prepare the Marinade<br><br>1. **Combine the marinade ingredients** in a bowl. Mix together the white miso paste, mirin, sugar, soy sauce, sake, sesame oil, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is well combined. <br><br>2. **Marinate the sablefish** fillets. Place the fillets in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Ensure the fillets are evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for deeper flavor. <br><br>#### Step 2: Preheat the Broiler<br><br>1. **Preheat your broiler** to high. Position the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. <br><br>#### Step 3: Broil the Sablefish<br><br>1. **Remove the fillets from the marinade** and pat them dry with paper towels. This step helps achieve a crispy skin. <br><br>2. **Place the fillets on a broiler pan** or a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Brush the fillets with a bit of the leftover marinade to enhance flavor and prevent drying. <br><br>3. **Broil the fillets** for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the skin is crispy and the fish is cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 145°F (63°C). <br><br>#### Step 4: Serve<br><br>1. **Garnish the fillets** with chopped green onions and serve with lemon wedges on the side. The acidity of the lemon complements the rich flavor of the sablefish. <br><br>### Tips for Success<br><br>- **Broiler Pan**: Using a broiler pan allows excess fat to drip away from the fish, preventing flare-ups and ensuring even cooking.<br>- **Watch Closely**: Keep a close eye on the fillets while broiling to avoid overcooking, which can make the fish dry and tough.<br>- **Flavor Variations**: Feel free to experiment with the marinade ingredients. Adding a splash of rice vinegar or a pinch of red pepper flakes can add an extra layer of flavor.<br><br>### Conclusion<br><br>Broiling sablefish after marinating it in a mixture of white miso paste, mirin, sugar, soy sauce, and sake results in a dish that is both flavorful and elegant. This method brings out the natural richness of the fish while adding a delightful umami depth from the marinade. Enjoy this gourmet experience at home with a simple yet effective technique.<br><br>**References**<br><br>1. Marinade ingredients and preparation.<br>2. Marinating time and process.<br>3.
